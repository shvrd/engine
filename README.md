A low-level, yet easy to use cross-platform 2d game engine for medium to big game projects.
Written in c++ with platform independency in mind, this engine offers high performance for visually appealing two-dimensional games for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Features

* Easy to use graphics abstraction
* Custom shader support
* Included Sound System

## Known Issues

* **The Windows build is still undergoing work. If you have experience using MinGW your help would be much appreciated! :)**

The required development libraries are:
